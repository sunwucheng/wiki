<ul>
<li>About 30 minutes</li>
<li>Extra 10 minutes at the end</li>
<li>40 questions</li>
<li>4 sections of 10 questions</li>

<li>one speaker gives basic information</li>
<li>simple gap-fill: missing details</li>
<li>names, addresses, dates, times, numbers</li>
<li>section 1 is easy, but you need a high score (9 or 10 correct)</li>
</ul>
<p>Key technique: Use the breaks to read ahead (Don’t check back, read ahead)</p>
<ul>
<li>before each section starts</li>
<li>in the middle of each section (except in section 4)</li>
<li>at the end of each section</li>
</ul>
<p>Section 2</p>
<ul>
<li>use all of the break time at the end of section 1</li>
<li>one speaker only</li>
<li>a short speech about a non-academic topic, e.g., tourism, a park, local facilities</li>
<li>gap-fill, multiple, choice, matching</li>
<li>still quite easy, aim for a high score</li>
</ul>
<p>Section 3</p>
<ul>
<li>use breaks to read and underline</li>
<li>two or three speakers</li>

<li>underline keywords</li>
<li>no break in the middle!</li>
<li>one speaker only</li>
<li>speech about an academic topic</li>
<li>gap-fill, multiple choice</li>
<li>listen for keywords or synonyms</li>
<li>difficult: faster speech, more content, extra information</li>
</ul>
<p>Know the test: Do some real practice tests</p>
<p>Tips</p>
<ol>

<li>Just say the first thing that comes into your head and keep going about that</li>
<li>The examiner is not judging the quality of your answers</li>

<li>Give long, detailed answers</li>
<li>This is your final chance to impress the examiner!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We need a method: follow 3 steps (or sometimes 4)<ul>
<li>Force yourself to follow these steps</li>
<li>Otherwise your answers won’t have ‘direction’</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Steps<ol>
<li>Answer the question directly</li>
<li>Explain your answer (reasons)</li>
<li>Give an example</li>
<li>Explain the opposite / alternative (what would happen if …)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Example<ul>
<li>(Question) Do you think it’s better to have clear aims for the future, or is it best to take each day as it comes?</li>
<li>(Answer) I think it’s best to have a good idea of what you want to do with your life, especially in terms of studies and career. (Why) Having aims allows you to plan what you need to do today and tomorrow in order to achieve longer-term objectives. (Example) For example, if you want to become a doctor, you need to choose the right subjects at school, get the right exam results, and work hard at university. (Opposite) Without a clear aim, it would be impossible to take the necessary steps towards a career in medicine, or any other profession.</li>

</li>
<li>Note<ul>
<li>My aim focus is on my answer structure (following the steps), not on grammar or vocabulary.</li>

<ul>
<li>introduce the topic (paraphrase what the question is saying)</li>
<li>give a general answer</li>
</ul>
<p>Four types of question</p>
<ol>
<li>Discussion</li>
<li>Opinion</li>
<li>Problem and solution</li>
<li>Two-part question</li>
</ol>
<p>Type 1 - Discussion<br>Question: Some people think that it is more effective for students to study in groups, while others believe that it is better for them to study alone. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.<br>Plan: Topic - study in groups or alone; Answer - sometimes better alone, usually better in a group<br>Answer: People have different views about the effectiveness of group study as opposed to working alone. While there are some benefits to studying independently, I believe that group work is usually more productive.</p>
<p>Type 2 - Opinion<br>Question: Some people believe that unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programmes. To what extents do you agree or disagree?<br>Plan: Topic - community service for all teenagers; Answer - 3 choices: agree, disagree, or balanced opinion (when possible)<br>Answer: It is sometimes argued that high school students should be made to do some work in their local communities. (Agree) I completely agree that this kind of scheme would be a good idea. (Disagree) In my opinion, it would be wrong to force teenagers to do any kind of unsalaried work. (Balanced opinion)(not fitting here, but to mention both sides) While I disagree with the idea of making such programmes compulsory, I do believe that voluntary community service could benefit young people.</p>
<p>Type 3 - Problem and solution<br>Question: Many criminals reoffend after they have been punished. Why do some people continue to commit crimes after they have been punished, and what measures can be taken to tackle this problem?<br>Plan: Topic - crimes reoffend; Answer - several reasons, a variety of measures (governments, communities)<br>Answer: It is true that punishments do not always deter criminals from committing more crimes. There are various reasons why offenders repeatedly break the law, but governments could certainly take steps to address this issue.</p>
<p>Type 4 - Two-part question<br>Question: As most people spend a major part of their adult life at work, job satisfaction is an important element of individual well-being. What factors contribute to job satisfaction? How realistic is the expectation of job satisfaction for all workers?<br>Plan: Topic - job satisfaction; Answer - several factors, unrealistic / impossible<br>Answer: Work plays a central role in our lives, and we would all like to feel fulfilled professionally. While a variety of factors may lead to job satisfaction, it would be unrealistic to expect everyone to be happy at work.</p>

<li>Idea, Explain, Example: one idea, a reason, an opinion</li>
</ul>
<p>Type 1 - Firstly, Secondly, Finally<br>Question: Some people believe that unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programmes. To what extents do you agree or disagree?<br>3-minute plan: (0) disagree for several reasons; (1) school timetable is full, no time for community service; (2) students work in other subjects would be affected; (3) teenagers might not want to do it (reluctant, no motivation)<br>Answer: There are several reasons why I would argue against having compulsory community service for secondary school students. Firstly, the school curriculum is already full with important academic subjects, such as maths, science and languages. For example, I remember having an extremely busy timetable when I was at high school, and it would not have been possible to add to it. Secondly, students’ performance in other subjects would be affected if valuable study time were taken by charity work nor neighbourhood improvement schemes. Finally, I believe that teenage students would be reluctant to take part in any programme of obligatory work, and this could lead to poor motivation and even bad behaviour. </p>
<p>Summary - Try to write 5 sentences</p>

</ul>
<p>Type 2 - Idea, Explain, Example<br>Question: Some people believe that unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programmes. To what extents do you agree or disagree?<br>3-minute plan: (0) voluntary (not compulsory) community service is positive; (1) students more motivated if they can choose; (2) gain work experience, self confidence, skills; (3) good for CVs, career, university admissions, employers<br>Answer: On the other hand, the opportunity to do voluntary community service could be extremely positive for high school students. By making these programmes optional, schools would ensure that only motivated students took part. These young people would gain valuable experience in an adult working environment, which could help to build their self confidence and enhance their skills. Having such experience and skills on their CVs could greatly improve school leavers’ career prospects. For example, a period of voluntary work experience might impress a university admissions officer or a future employer.</p>

<p>Examples of how to deal with the 4 types of IELTS writing task 2 question<br>(1) Discussion (+ opinion)<br>Question: In many cities the use of video cameras in public places is being increased in order to reduce crime, but some people believe that these measures restrict our individual freedom. Do the benefits of increased security outweigh the drawbacks?<br>Introduction: It is true that video surveillance has become commonplace in many cities in recent years. While I understand that critics may see this as an invasion of privacy, I believe that there are more benefits than drawbacks.<br>Conclusion: In conclusion, I would argue that the advantages of using video security systems in public places do outweigh the disadvantages.<br>(2) Opinion<br>Question: Families who send their children to private schools should not be required to pay taxes that support the state education system. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?<br>Introduction: Some people believe that parents of children who attend private schools should not need to contribute to state schools through taxes. Personally, I completely disagree with this view.<br>Conclusion: In conclusion, I do not believe that any financial concessions should be made for people who choose private education.<br>(3) Problem and solution<br>Question: In the developed world, average life expectancy is increasing. What problems will this cause for individuals and society?

Although there will undoubtedly be some negative consequences of this trend, societies can take steps to mitigate these potential problems.<br>Conclusion: In conclusion, various measures can be taken to tackle the problems that are certain to arise as the populations of countries grow older.<br>(4) 2-part question<br>Question: There are many different types of music in the world today. Why do we need music? Is the traditional music of a country more important than the international music that is heard everywhere nowadays?<br>Introduction: It is true that a rich variety of musical styles can be found around the world. Music is a vital part of all human cultures for a range of reasons, and I would argue that traditional music is more important than modern, international music.<br>Conclusion: In conclusion, music is a necessary part of human existence, and I believe that traditional music should be given more importance than international music.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>Paragraph 1 - Introduction - Topic = government spending; Answer = agree, public services instead of space projects<br>Governments in some countries spend large amounts of money on space exploration programmes. I completely agree with the idea that these are a waste of money, and that the funds should be allocated to public services.</p>
<p>Paragraph 2 - Main body 1 - Why space spending should be stopped<br>There are several reasons why space programmes should be abandoned. Firstly, it is extremely expensive to train scientists and other staff involved with space missions, and facilities and equipment also come at. a huge cost to the government. Secondly, these programmes do not benefit normal people in our daily lives; they are simply vanity projects for politicians. Finally, many missions to space fail completely, and the smallest technological error can cost astronauts their lives. The Challenger space shuttle disaster showed us that space travel is extremely dangerous, and in my opinion it is not worth the risk.</p>
<p>Paragraph 3 - Main body 2 - Why public service spending is better<br>I believe that the money from space programmes should go to vital public services instead. It is much cheaper to train doctors, teachers, police and other public service workers than it is to train astronauts or the scientists and engineers who work on space exploration projects. Further more, public servants do jobs that have a positive impact on every member of society. For example, we all use schools, hospitals and roads, and we all need the security that the police provide. If governments reallocated the money spent on space travel and research, many thousands of people could be lifted out of poverty or given a better quality of life.</p>
<p>Paragraph 4 - Conclusion - spend on services that benefit us all<br>In conclusion, my view is that governments should spend money on services that benefit all members of society, and it is wrong to waste resources on projects that do not improve our everyday lives.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>Paragraph 1 - Introduction<br>People have different views about whether children should be taught to be competitive or co-operative. While a spirit of competition can sometimes be useful in life, I believe that the ability to co-operate is more important.</p>
<p>Paragraph 2 - Main body 1 - Why encourage competition? (motivation)<br>On the one hand, competition can be of great source of motivation for children. When teachers use games or prizes to introduce an element of competitiveness into lessons, it can encourage children to work harder to outdo the other pupils in the class. This kind of healthy rivalry may help to build children’s self confidence, while punishing them to work independently and progress more quickly. When these children leave school, their confidence and determination will help them in competitive situations such as job interviews. It can therefore be argued that competition should be encouraged in order to prepare children for adult life.</p>
<p>Paragraph 3 - Main body 2 - Why teach co-operation<br>On the other hand, it is perhaps even more important to prepare children for the many aspects of adult life that require co-operation. In the workplace, adults are expected to work in teams, follow instructions given by their superiors, or supervise and support the more junior members of staff. Team collaboration skills are much more useful than a competitive determination to win. This is the attitude that I believe schools should foster in young people. Instead of promoting the idea that people are either winners or losers, teachers could show children that they gain more from working together.</p>
<p>Paragraph 4 - Conclusion - accept both views, co-operation better<br>In conclusion, I can understand why people might want to encourage competitiveness in children, but it seems to me that a co-operative attitude is much more desirable in adult life.</p>

</ol>
<p>Paragraph 1 - Introduction<br>It is true that behaviour of school pupils in some parts of the world has been getting worse in recent years. There are a variety of possible reasons for this, but steps can definitely be taken to tackle the problem.</p>
<p>Paragraph 2 - Main body 1 - Causes of bad student behaviour<br>In my opinion, three main factors are to blame for the way young people behave at school nowadays. Firstly, modern parents tend to be too lenient or permissive. Many children become accustomed to getting whatever they want, and they find it difficult to accept the demands of teachers or the limits imposed on them by school rules. Secondly, if teachers cannot control their students, there must be an issue with the quality of classroom management training or support within schools. Finally, children are influenced by the behaviour of celebrities, many if whom set the example that success can be achieved without finishing school.</p>
<p>Paragraph 3 - Main body 2 - My suggested solutions<br>Students behaviour can certainly be improved. I believe that the change must start with parents, who need to be persuaded that it is important to set firm rules for their children. When children misbehave or break the rules, parents should use reasonable punishments to demonstrate that actions have consequences. Also, schools could play an important role in training both teachers and parents to use effective disciplinary techniques, and in improving the communication between both groups. At the same time, famous people, such as musicians and football players, need to understand the responsibility that they have to act as role models to children.</p>
<p>Paragraph 4 - Conclusion - summarise the problem and steps<br>In conclusion, schools will continue to face discipline problems unless parents, teachers and public figures set clear rules and demonstrate the right behaviour themselves.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>Paragraph 1 - Introduction<br>It is true that editors have to make difficult decisions about which news stories they broadcast or publish, and their choice are no doubt influenced by a variety of factors. In my opinion, we are exposed to too much bad news, and I would welcome a greater emphasis on good news.</p>
<p>Paragraph 2 - Main body 1 - Variety of factors that influence news editors<br>Editors face a range of considerations when deciding what news stories to focus on. Firstly, I imagine that they have to consider whether viewers or readers will be interested enough to choose their television channel or their newspaper over competing providers. Secondly, news editors have a responsibility to inform the public about important events and issues, and they should therefore priorities stories that are in the public interest. Finally, editors are probably under some pressure from the owners who employ them. For example, a newspaper owner might have particular political views that he or she wants to promote.</p>
<p>Paragraph 3 - Main body 2 - Too much bad news, should report more good<br>It seems to me that people do become accustomed to negative news. We are exposed on a daily basis to stories about war, crime, natural disasters and tragic human suffering around the world. I believe that such repeated exposure gradually desensitises people, and we become more cynical about the world and more sceptical that we can do anything to change it. I would prefer to see more positive news stories, such as reports of the work of medical staff after a natural disaster, or the kindness of volunteers who help in their communities. This kind of news might inspire us all to lead better lives.</p>
<p>Paragraph 4 - Conclusion - difficult news choice, more positive<br>In conclusion, it must be extremely difficult for editors to choose which news stories to present, but I would like to see a more positive approach to this vital public service.</p>

<p>Question: The money spent by government on space programmes would be better spent on vital public services such as schools and hospitals. To what extent do you agree or disagree?</p>
<p>Paragraph 1 - Introduction<br>Governments in some countries spend large amounts of money on space exploration programmes. I completely agree with the idea that these are a waste of money, and that the funds should be allocated to public services.</p>
<p>Paragraph 2 - Main body 1 - explain why ‘space’ spending should be stopped<br>There are several reasons why space programmes should be abandoned. Firstly, it is extremely expensive to train scientists and other staff involved with space missions, and facilities and equipment also come at. a huge cost to the government. Secondly, these programmes do not benefit normal people in our daily lives; they are simply vanity projects for politicians. Finally, many missions to space fail completely, and the smallest technological error can cost astronauts their lives. The Challenger space shuttle disaster showed us that space travel is extremely dangerous, and in my opinion it is not worth the risk.</p>
<p>Paragraph 3 - Main body 2 - explain why public service spending is better<br>I believe that the money from space programmes should go to vital public services instead. It is much cheaper to train doctors, teachers, police and other public service workers than it is to train astronauts or the scientists and engineers who work on space exploration projects. Further more, public servants do jobs that have a positive impact on every member of society. For example, we all use schools, hospitals and roads, and we all need the security that the police provide. If governments reallocated the money spent on space travel and research, many thousands of people could be lifted out of poverty or given a better quality of life.</p>
<p>Paragraph 4 - Conclusion - spend on services that benefit us all<br>In conclusion, my view is that governments should spend money on services that benefit all members of society, and it is wrong to waste resources on projects that do not improve our everyday lives.</p>
<p>Question: Some people believe that hobbies need to be difficult to be enjoyable. To what extent do you agree or disagree?</p>

<p>Paragraph 1 - Introduction<br>It is true that many people critics modern society because it seems to be too materialistic. I agree with this to some extent, but I do not think it is the case that everyone is a victim of consumer culture.</p>
<p>Paragraph 2 - Main body 1 - I believe many people do focus too much on money</p>

<p>Question: The graph below shows electricity production (in terawatt hours) in France between 1980 and 2012.</p>
<p>Paragraph 1 - Introduction - paraphrase the question<br>The line graph compares the amount of electricity produced in France using four different sources of power over a period of 32 year.</p>
<p>Paragraph 2 - Overview - 2 sentences, 2 main points<br>It is clear that nuclear power was by far the most important means of electricity generation over the period shown. Renewables provided the lowest amount of electricity in each year. </p>
<p>Paragraph 3 - Detail 1 - compare the lines<br>In 1980, the thermal power stations were the main source of electricity in France, generating around 120 terawatt hours of power. Nuclear and hydroelectric power stations produced just under 75 terawatt hours of electricity each, and renewables provided a negligible amount. Just one year later, nuclear power overtook thermal power as the primary source of electricity.</p>

By contrast, the figure for thermal power fell to only 50 terawatt hours in 1985, and remained at this level for the rest of the period. Hydroelectric power generation remained relatively stable, at between 50 and 80 terawatt hours, for the whole 32-year period, but renewable electricity production saw only a small rise to approximately 25 terawatt hours by 2012.</p>

<p>Paragraph 2 - Overview - 2 sentences, 2 main points<br>It is noticeable that the proportion of spending on food and drink fell in both countries over the 28-year period, while spending on utility bills rose. Also, UK residents spent a significantly larger percentage of their household budgets in leisure than their New Zealand counterparts.</p>
<p>Paragraph 3 - Detail 1<br>In 1980, 29% of an average New Zealand household budget went on food and drink, while the equivalent figure for a UK home was 23%. By 2008, expenditure on food and drink had fallen by 4% in New Zealand, and by a full 10% in the UK. By contrast, both countries saw an increase in expenditure on utility bills for the average home, from 27% to 31% in New Zealand and from 26% to 28% in the UK.</p>
<p>PS: The same information as the overview, but in more detail</p>
<p>Paragraph 4 - Detail 2<br>Leisure activities accounted for the highest proportion of UK household spending in both years, but only the third highest proportion in New Zealand. In fact, in 2008, New Zealanders spent only half as much in relative terms on recreation (17%) as UK residents (34%).

<p>Question: The table below shows statistics about the top five countries for international tourism in 2012 and 2013</p>
<p>Paragraph 1 - Introduction - paraphrase the question<br>The table compares the five highest ranking countries in terms of the numbers of visits and the money spent by tourists over a period of two years.</p>
<p>Paragraph 2 - Overview - 2 sentences, 2 main points<br>It is clear that France was the world’s most popular tourist destination in the years 2012 and 2013. However, the USA earned by far the most revenue from tourism over the same period.</p>
<p>Paragraph 3 - Detail 1<br>In 2012, 83 million tourists visited France, and the USA was the second most visited country, with 66.7 million tourists. Spain and China each received just under 58 million visitors, while Italy was ranked fifth with 46.4 million tourists. 2013 saw a rise of between 1 and 4 million tourist visits to each country, with the exception of China, which received 2 million fewer visitors than in the previous year.</p>
<p>Paragraph 4 - Detail 2<br>Spending by tourists visiting USA increased from $126.2 billion in 2012 to $139.6 billion in 2013, and these figures were well over twice as high as those for any other country. Spain received the second highest amounts of tourist revenue, rising from $56.3 billion to $60.4 billion, followed by France, China and Italy. Interestingly, despite falling numbers of tourists, Chinese revenue from tourism rose by $1.7 billion in 2013.</p>

<ul>
<li>These are questions with 2 different charts, which you can’t compare together</li>
<li>Your job is to select, describe and compare the key numbers</li>
<li>But you don’t need to compare the 2 charts together - you can describe them separately</li>
<li>First, look for one main feature i each chart  (summary / overview paragraph) </li>
<li>Second, describe specific numbers for each chart separately (‘details’ paragraphs)</li>

<p>Question: The bar chart below shows the numbers of men and women attending various evening courses at an adult education centre in the year 2009. The pie chart gives information about the ages of these course participants.</p>
<p>Paragraph 1 - Introduction - paraphrase the question<br>The bar chart compares the numbers of males and females who took four different evening classes in 2009, and the pie chart shows the age profile of these attendees.</p>
<p>Paragraph 2 - Overview - 2 sentences, 2 main points<br>It is clear that significantly more women than men attended evening classes at the education centre. We can also see that evening courses were much more popular among older adults</p>
<p>Paragraph 3 - Detail 1<br>According to the bar chart, drama, painting and language courses all attracted more women than men to the education centre in 2009. Language classes had the highest number of participants overall, with 40 female and 20 male students, while painting was a popular choice among both genders, attracting 30 female and 25 male attendees. The only course with a higher number of males was sculpture, but this course was taken by a mere 15 people in total.</p>
<p>Paragraph 4 - Detail 2<br>Looking at the age profile pie chart, we can see that the majority of people attending evening lessons were over 40 years of age. To be precise, 42% of them were aged 50 or more, and 26% were aged between 40 and 49. Younger adults were in the majority, with only 11% of students aged 20 to 29, and only 5% aged under 20.</p>

<p>Paragraph 2 - Overview - 2 sentences, 2 main points<br>We can see that glass is made using three main raw materials, and that the manufacturing process consists of four distinct stages. It requires five steps to turn used glass into new glass products.</p>
<p>Paragraph 3 - Detail 1<br>At the first stage in the production of glass, sand, soda ash, limestone and other chemicals are mixed together. Next, this mixture is heated in a glass furnace at approximately 1500°C to produce molten glass. The molten glass can then be shaped by blowing, to create the end products, namely glass containers.</p>
<p>Paragraph 4 - Detail 2<br>Glass recycling begins with the collection of used glass products. The collected glass is sorted according to its colour, and then washed in order to remove any impurities. At the fourth stage of recycling, the glass is crushed and melted, and the resulting molten glass can finally be moulded to create new items.</p>

<p>Paragraph 1 - Introduction - paraphrase the question<br>The two pictures compare the current layout of the ground floor of a house with a plan to redesign the same living space.</p>
<p>Paragraph 2 - Overview - 2 sentences, 2 main points<br>We can see that the new design proposal involves making a number of changes to the ground floor of the house, mainly in the central hall area. There are no plans to change external walls or entrances.</p>
<p>Paragraph 3 - Detail 1<br>The most noticeable change from the existing to the proposed floor plan is that there will no longer be a separate hall area when the building work has been down. This will be achieved by removing the internal wall and door between the hall and living room, along with the current staircase and under-stair storage cupboard. With no separate hall area, the proposed living room will also contain the staircase to the first floor.</p>
<p>Paragraph 4 - Detail 2<br>To replace the current straight staircase, a new set of winding stairs will be installed in the corner of the living room. The internal door between the hall and kitchen will also be replaced with double doors connecting the kitchen with the new living room.
